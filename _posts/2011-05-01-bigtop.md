Big Top was an experiment in creating distorted, abstract geometric
forms by using motion of the human body as the deformer for an inital
3d shape.

Big Top was created in Processing, using the <a href="http://s373.net/code/flob/flob.html" title="Flob Library" target="_blank">Flob</a> library for computer vision and blob detection, and the <a href="http://hemesh.wblut.com/" title="Hemesh Library" target="_blank">Hemesh</a> library for the mesh creation and deformation.
