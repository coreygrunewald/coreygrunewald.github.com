In recent years, the Baltimore Orioles have consistently had one of the
worst records in baseball. However, when you go to a game at Camden
Yards, the field is still beautiful, the crowds still cheer. What if the
Orioles record distorted this vision?

The game was the Orioles vs. the Devil Rays on May 7, 2011 (the Orioles lost 2-8). The footage was cut together, and run through a Quartz Composer patch. The audio levels of the spectators cheers triggers the distortion of the footage. The type of distortion is determined by streaming data of the Orioles performances over the years.
