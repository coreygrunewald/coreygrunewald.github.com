4Castr (<a href="http://4castr.cgrune.com/" target="_blank" title="4Castr">www.4castr.cgrune.com</a>) is an interactive weather forecasting application intended for
children. Instead of representing weather the traditional way with icons
of clouds, the sun, wind, etc., 4Castr uses animals to help better
relate the upcoming conditions. There are four different animals
associated with temperature ranges. A polar bear for when it's really
cold, a fox for when it's chilly, a lizard for mild to hot, and a camel
for when it's scorching. The animals rotation is dependent on the wind
speed projected for that day.

4Castr was created in Processing using <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/" title="Wunderground" target="_blank">WeatherUnderground's</a> API. The
animals were modeled in Maya.
