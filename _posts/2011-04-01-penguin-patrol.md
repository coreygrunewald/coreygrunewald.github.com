How did America get it's Penguins? They surely didn't fly here from the
South Pole. Penguins arrived in America because of the hardwork of
Anartic Development Squadron Six. This documentary follows one of the
members of this squadron as he recounts his time in Antartica capturing
our little black and white friends.

This documentary won first place at the 2011 VCU Student Film Festival.
