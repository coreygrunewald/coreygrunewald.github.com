I've been working in [Processing](http://www.processing.org "Processing") for at least 3 years now. Besides basic HTML and CSS, it was how I began to learn what programming was.

</div>

As I'm sure with everyone starting out working with Processing, one
would use the provided PDE (Processing Development Environment).
However, once I started moving into more serious programming in Java, I
started to use Eclipse as my IDE.

</div>

As my progression continued with coding and Processing, I did see that
some people were using Eclipse to develop Processing applications, but
the PDE was still serving my purposes just fine, until I started a
recent project. I'm currently working on migrating a system from
VirTools over to a Processing application that will interface with
Unity3D for my professor [Semi Ryu](http://www.semiryu.net "Semi Ryu").

I decided to make the switch over to Eclipse for this project, and there
is a plugin that makes life a lot easier. Introducing
[Proclipsing](http://code.google.com/p/proclipsing/ "Proclipsing"). Now
I have all the benefits of Eclipse like code completion and syntax
checking that speeds up the process of developing an app. No longer do I
have to make a change to the code, click "Run", see if it compiles, and
watch my handywork like I did in PDE.

Once this project is done, I would like to jump into [Ruby-Processing](https://github.com/jashkenas/ruby-processing "Ruby-Processing"). It extends Processing even more using the power of Ruby. Here are some features:

- Live Coding: change your variables and methods on the fly.
- A control panel library to create tactile controls for sketch
  variables.
- The fact that it is Ruby.

Now we will just have to wait until Processing 2.0 to come out.
